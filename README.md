[00:03.47] You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
[00:07.56] Wasn't ready to hear you say, "Goodbye"
[00:11.57] Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
[00:15.47] You're tearing me apart
[00:26.97] 
[00:18.93] You're so London, your own style, your own style
[00:23.10] And together we're so good
[00:25.63] So girl, why are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart?
[00:31.00] You're tearing me apart
[00:42.50] 
[00:33.72] Did I do something stupid?
[00:35.83] Yeah, girl, if I blew it
[00:37.74] Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
[00:41.64] There's gotta be some way
[00:43.51] To get you to want me, like before
[01:00.51] 
[00:48.26] 'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
[00:52.08] And it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
[00:56.26] No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
[01:00.79] Baby, tell me how to make it right
[01:17.79] 
[01:04.87] Now all of my friends say, it's not really worth it
[01:08.75] But even if that's true
[01:11.78] No one in the world could stop me from not movin' on
[01:16.24] Baby, even if I wanted to
[01:19.32] Nobody compares to you
[01:30.32] 
[01:24.72] We're so Paris, when we kissed, when we kissed
[01:28.88] I remember the taste of your lipstick
[01:32.67] Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
[01:36.84] You're tearing up my heart
[01:49.84] 
[01:39.46] Did I do something stupid?
[01:41.65] Yeah, girl, if I blew it
[01:43.64] Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
[01:47.40] There's gotta be some way
